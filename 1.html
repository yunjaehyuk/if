The TAG is a special group within the W3C
  <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
</p>
<p style="margin-top:60px;">chartered under the W3C Process Document,
  with stewardship of the Web architecture.</p> The mission of the TAG is
  to build consensus around principles of Web architecture and to interpret
  and clarify these principles when necessary, to resolve issues involving
   general Web architecture brought to the TAG, and to help coordinate cross-tec
   hnology architecture developments inside and outside W3C. The elected Members of
   the TAG participate as individual contributors, not as representatives of their
    organizations. TAG participants use their best judgment to find the best solutions
     for the Web, not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user. L
